            </h3>
            <h5>
                I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame studying computer science. 
                Throughout my studies, I have really enjoyed the fast paced and creative environment of software development. 
                Outside of CS, I am a stand-up comic and and love to write and perform jokes to a crowd, as well as perform improv comedy.
                Also, although it can be difficult to watch sometimes, I am a Chicago sports fan who looks forward to watching games with friends.
