                    <h5>What is MEWS?</h6>
                    <p>
                        The MEWS (Misinformation Early Warning System) helps identify misinformation trends 
                        in real time as they occur on social media. MEWS is intended to be used by journalists, 
                        civil society organizations, and some government agencies.
                    </p>
                    <h5>How does it work?</h6>
                    <p>
                        MEWS operates through a distributed task management platform called celery, which allows us to 
                        queue tasks for compute nodes to operate on asynchronously. We call this the chain. The chain 
                        starts by pulling images and metadata from social media platforms and storing them into our database. 
                        Next, we perform optical character recognition on these images to store text that was placed over or 
                        within an image. After that, our images are sent through manipulation detection or ADQ2 to spot 
                        potential image manipulations. We then utilize detectron2 from Facebook Research to recognize objects 
                        within the image that we will use in the provenance portion of the pipeline later. Then, using Insight 
                        Face and Trenton Fords WikiFace’s package, we are able to detect and sometimes recognize people in an 
                        image. We then find features in the image that we can compare across the entire database. Finally, we 
                        generate a graph using similarities detected within the image itself, text pulled from OCR, objects 
                        found in the image, people, captions, and associated hashtags.
